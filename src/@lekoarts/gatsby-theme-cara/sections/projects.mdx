  This project is my entry to React-Spring, Leaflet and Material-UI.
The app is dead-simple : <strong>Find me a flight near my location for a week-end</strong>.
The main goal is to reduce the numbers of clicks required to display relevant offers around you <br />
<br />

<strong>Give it a try !</strong>

  A React-powered blog for my dad's association.<br /> From UI conception to ssl
  certificate. The main goal is to have a <strong>nice and slick design for a blog that is efficient </strong> <br />{" "}
  Another key feature is the headless CMS <strong>Strapi</strong>. It's running the CMS and the back-office smoothly <br />

Building a project from A to Z like that was really enlightening

  Another note app ... yes but <strong>serverless</strong> ! <br /> Here I've
  used serverless-stack recommendations, not a single server is required <br />{" "}
  The main goal was to produce an app with the micro-service architecture. I am
  really impressed about powerful it is. Scaling becomes super-easy in seconds
  and the cost are reduced to a minimum. #NodeJs #Serverless #AWS #AWS #Sentry
